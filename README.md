# Django for IoT
Cookiecutter template for IoT projects using Django (with celery and Heroku support)

# Set up your local development environment
## Environment
You'll always need this:
```
export SECRET_KEY=[your value]
```

The default database is sqlite3. If you're using Postgres, then set up a database:
```
createdb django_iot
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/django_iot
```

This project is compatible with celery using a RabbitMQ (amqp) backend.
To use celery locally, [install RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html),
then run rabbit in the background:
```
rabbitmq-server &
```

## Django
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

## Run the development server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

If you navigate to http://localhost:8000, you should see a filler template.

If you navigate to http://localhost:8000/admin, you should be able to sign in using your superuser account
and see admin pages for the `Device`, `Attribute`, and `PowerStatus` models.

# Make your app
Start by running the tests:
```
python manage.py test
```

The tests in the `devices` and `observations` apps should pass, but the tests in the `interactions` app should fail.

To make a working app, edit `django_iot/django_iot/apps/interactions/tasks.py`
to actually perform your tasks. Also update the tests at `django_iot/django_iot/apps/interactions/tests/test_tasks.py` accordingly.

If you add any kwargs to tasks, make sure to add them using `add_argument` in `django_iot/django_iot/apps/interactions/management/commands/interact.py`.

If you're using celery, you may also want to adjust the schedule of tasks in `django_iot/django_iot/apps/interactions/schedule.py`.

And if you want a web UI that's more fun than the default admin, you'll want to add views to one or more of the apps (and to `django_iot/django_iot/urls.py`).

# Deploy to Heroku
## Basic deploy
After you've git-committed all your local changes, just create a Heroku app with the basic environment variables, push, and set up the initial database:
```
heroku create django-iot-demo
heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=django_iot.settings.production
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=[your value]
git push heroku master
heroku run python manage.py migrate
heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Using management commands + Heroku Scheduler
Add the free Heroku Scheduler add-on:
```
heroku addons:create scheduler:standard
```
Then go to https://scheduler.heroku.com/dashboard and schedule management commands (eg `python manage.py interact refresh_all`).

**Warnings**:
* job scheduling is inflexible compared to celery
* jobs are not guaranteed to run

## Using celery + CloudAMQP
Add the CloudAMQP add-on at the free level:
```
heroku addons:create cloudamqp:lemur
```

Then spin up one `scheduler` dyno.

**Warnings**:
* this will start running the schedule defined in `django_iot/django_iot/apps/interactions/schedule.py`
* the scheduler dyno will sleep whenever the web dyno is sleeping, even if the crontab would otherwise be triggering a task
* do not spin up more than one scheduler dyno--if you need more than one, add a line to your `Procfile` like `celery worker -A django_iot -l info` (the difference is the lack of `-B`)

```
heroku ps:scale scheduler=1
```
